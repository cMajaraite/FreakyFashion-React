# ðŸ‘— FreakyFashion - React

This is a full-stack fashion e-commerce store built with **React** for the frontend and **SQLite** for the backend.  
The project was created as part of a school assignment at *EC Utbildning* to practice using the React.js library and building full-stack applications.  
I developed it together with my classmate [Isabelle](https://github.com/IsabelleBan).
